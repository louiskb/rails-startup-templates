# shared/friendly_urls.rb
# Shared Friendly URLs Template

# TWO USE CASES:
# 1. Fresh app: called from main template INSIDE `after_bundle` (gems already added/bundles by main template).
# 2. Existing app: Standalone - applying the shared template with an existing app (e.g. `rails app:template LOCATION=shared/friendly_urls.rb`).

# GUARD 1: Skip if Friendly URLs is already installed.

# STANDALONE SUPPORT: Add gem if missing (existing apps only).
# Inside conditional, once gem added to `Gemfile`, run `bundle install` if not already executed.
# Fresh apps: main template already added gem → this skips.

# STANDALONE MIGRATION SUPPORT
